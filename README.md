Titanic Survival Prediction

The first step involves loading the Titanic Survival Prediction dataset into a DataFrame and exploring its structure, including its feature columns and the target variable. This exploration helps in understanding the data and identifying any missing values, which can be handled through imputation or removal. Necessary data transformations, such as scaling or encoding categorical variables, are also performed to prepare the data for analysis. In the next step, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to gain insights into the relationships between features and the target variable. This includes visualizing the data using plots, histograms, and scatter plots to identify patterns, correlations, and outliers. Additionally, calculating summary statistics provides an understanding of the distribution and central tendencies of the variables, further informing the analysis.
